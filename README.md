# the-list
Inspired by a comment on /r/soccer, which inspired a subreddit called /r/SaddestBackflip now turns into a website since people keep having to find different versions of the list

Probably easiest to create a static site based on Hugo, this theme seems to fit well: https://github.com/spaghettiwews/hugonews minimalistic HN-type of theme

People should be able to create a pull request for additions to the list, or create an issue so someone else can do it

Will probably add some maintainers since I don't want to be the arbiter of what constitutes a worthy addition
